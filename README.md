# About me

Hello everyone!!  My name is Luis Santiago Maya Restrepo, and I am currently a Software Engineer at a Big Tech company. I've worked in the software industry for about 4 years now and im really happy to be sharing all the things that I've learned through all these years. 
I am also in the last year of my underdegree in Systems and Informatics Engineering in Universidad Nacional de Colombia, at Medell√≠n. 

The areas of most interest to me are: software architecture, software design and artificial intelligence. 

Some couriosities about me:
- My top 3 favourite programming languages are: 1. Java 2. Python and 3. Scala.
- My favorite OS is MacOs, in genral, unix based operative systems.
- I don't like to view software as backend or frontend, it's too limiting. I like just to talk about software in general.
- I love playing chess. I love chess.
